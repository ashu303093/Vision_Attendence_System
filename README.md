# Vision_Attendence_System
We have created a Vision Based Attendence Sysytem which can register the user just by recognizing the face of the user.In this Project we have used MTCNN as Face detection Algorithm for detecting the face of the user and ArcFace as Face Recognition Algorithm ffor recognizing the face of the user.
